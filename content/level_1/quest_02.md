### The Mission
The emergency beacon needs a signal to light up. You must use Python's `print()` function to broadcast a message to the network.

### Instructions
1. Use the `print()` function to output the exact message: `SOS from Codexia!`
2. Make sure the text matches exactly — the beacon is very precise!

### Example
Here's how `print()` works:

```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

This would display `Hello, world!` in the terminal. Now use it to send the beacon signal!

```python starter
# Light the beacon! Send the signal below:

```
